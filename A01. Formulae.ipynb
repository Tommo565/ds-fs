Each element in the new matrix created by matrix multiplication is the sum of all the products of the elements in a row of the first matrix times a column in the second matrix. As such the number of rows in the first matrix must match the number of columns in the second matrix.<br/>\n",

    "Variance measures how far a data set is spread out. The technical definition is “The average of the squared differences from the mean,” but all it really does is to give you a very general idea of the spread of your data. It is expressed in square units whereas **Standard Deviation** is expressed in the same units at the mean. Note that there are slightly different ways of calculation variance depending upon whether you are working with a sample or a full population. See [Bessel's Correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction) for more details. The example below uses Bessel's correction.  \n",

As the term implies, a standard deviation is a standard (or typical) amount of deviation (or distance) from the average (or mean, as statisticians like to call it). So the standard deviation, in very rough terms, is the average distance from the mean. Note that there are slightly different ways of calculating standard deviation depending upon whether you are working with a sample or a full population.
