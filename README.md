Repo to hold my code for general data science and stats techniques. I hope to one day turn this into a training course but for now it'll serve as a good reference for me and my learning, development and consolidation.

Note that this is a work in progress and the chapters in the individual sections are not to be considered an exhaustive view of the subject. As I go through I'll be adding more chapters and sections.

The repo is made up of Jupyter Notebooks and is split into sections as follows:

###Section A: Statistics
	A00. Introduction to Statistics
	A01. Basic Statistics
	A02. Probability
	A03. Hypothesis & Inference

###Section B: Data Engineering
	A00. Introduction to Data Engineering
	Axx. Databases Types
	Axx. Airflow Pipelines
	Axx. Architecture
	Axx. Big Data Architecture
	Axx. Hadoop / Spark etc.

###Section C: Machine Learning
	D00. Introduction to Machine Learning
	D01. Linear Algebra
	D02. Gradient Descent
	D03. A First Machine Learning Project

###Section D: Deep Learning
	D00. Introduction to Deep Learning

###Section E: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	E00. Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

###Section F: Miscellaneous
	F00. Introduction to Miscellaneous
	F01. Github
	F02. Cloud Computing
	F03. Testing

###Section X: Appendices

###Section Z: Notes
